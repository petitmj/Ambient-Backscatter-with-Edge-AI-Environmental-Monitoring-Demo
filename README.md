# Ambient-Backscatter-with-Edge-AI-Environmental-Monitoring-Demo
This project provides a comprehensive simulation of an Ambient Backscatter Communication (AmBC) system integrated with Edge AI for intelligent data handling, designed to unlock the potential of battery-free Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It serves as a self-contained demonstration, implementing the entire pipeline in Python.
