# Ambient-Backscatter-with-Edge-AI-and Explainable-AI-(XAI)-Environmental-Monitoring-Demo

The Project presents a comprehensive, self-contained simulation of an **Ambient Backscatter Communication (AmBC) system** enhanced with **Edge AI and Explainable AI (XAI)**. The project focuses on a critical application: **battery-free environmental monitoring for public health**, particularly relevant for remote areas with limited infrastructure.

## Project Overview

Traditional IoT environmental sensors often rely on batteries, posing maintenance challenges in remote settings. This project demonstrates a sustainable solution using AmBC, where sensors operate battery-free by reflecting existing radio signals to transmit environmental data. We elevate this concept by integrating Edge AI for intelligent, real-time data processing and Explainable AI (XAI) to provide clear, actionable insights.

The entire AmBC pipeline—from ambient RF source generation to AI inference—is implemented purely in Python, making it fully runnable in cloud environments like Google Colab without the need for external GNU Radio files or pre-generated data.

## Key Features

  * **Battery-Free Communication (AmBC Simulation):** Simulates how low-power environmental sensors (e.g., for water quality or airborne pathogens) can encode data by subtly modulating existing ambient RF signals (like Wi-Fi or TV broadcasts), eliminating the need for internal power sources.
  * **Realistic Channel Modeling:** Incorporates real-world wireless impairments such as path loss and Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) to ensure the simulation's fidelity.
  * **Python-based Digital Signal Processing (DSP):** Demonstrates how a local hub (receiver) processes the noisy, backscattered RF signals using Python-implemented DSP techniques (complex to magnitude conversion, low-pass filtering) to extract raw environmental data.
  * **Edge AI for Anomaly Detection (TensorFlow Lite):**
      * **Intelligent Data Processing:** Trains and deploys lightweight neural networks (using TensorFlow Lite) on a simulated edge device to robustly decode environmental data even in noisy conditions.
      * **Real-time Anomaly Detection:** The AI model learns "normal" environmental patterns and flags unusual deviations (e.g., sudden contamination, pathogen spikes).
  * **Explainable AI (XAI) Integration:** Provides simple, human-understandable reasons for detected anomalies (e.g., "Anomaly due to unusually high average reading" or "very high variability/noise"). This crucial component empowers local healthcare workers to make informed decisions without needing deep AI expertise.

## Why this is important

  * **Sustainable IoT:** Enables continuous environmental monitoring in off-grid or hard-to-reach locations.
  * **Public Health Impact:** Provides early warnings for potential health hazards related to water and air quality.
  * **Empowering Local Communities:** XAI ensures that the technology is transparent and actionable for non-technical users, fostering trust and enabling rapid response.
  * **Accessible AI:** Demonstrates how complex AI/ML pipelines can be implemented and simulated using common Python libraries, reducing barriers to entry for researchers and developers.

## Getting Started

To run this simulation:

1.  **Open in Google Colab:** The easiest way to interact with this notebook is directly in Google Colab.

2.  **Run All Cells:** Once opened, simply go to `Runtime` -\> `Run all` to execute the entire simulation pipeline.
3.  **Explore Outputs:** The notebook will display various plots visualizing the signals at different stages (ambient RF, backscattered, received, demodulated) and the training/inference results of the Edge AI models. TensorFlow Lite models (`.tflite`) will be generated and saved in a `simulation_output` directory within your Colab session.
